CPlex project implementing the Operator Placement Problem (OPP).
The project structure provides the following directories:


- OFFICIAL: Contains the standard and alternative formulation both for Mathematical Programming (MP)
			and Constraint Programming (CP). The formulation follows the one stated in "Optimal DSP
			Deployment" by prof. Francesco Lo Presti. 

- CUSTOM:   Contains the standard and alternative formulation both for Mathematical Programming (MP)
			and Constraint Programming (CP). The formulation follows the one stated in "Posizionamento
			degli Operatori" by stud. Giacomo Marciani. 
			
- RUN CONF: COntains the run configurations for official/custom standard/alternative MP/CP formulation.


RESULTS
For now, the best formulation seems to be the Official MP Alternative.
